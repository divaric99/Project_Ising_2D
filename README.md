Monte Carlo methods and finite size analysis in paramagnetic-ferromagnetic models of phase transitions
Description and assignments

The objective is to study, by Monte Carlo simulations, Ising-like modes on the square lattice and look at the behaviour of observables such as the specific heat, magnetisation and magnetic susceptibility,
, as a function of the temperature ed in particular in proximity of the critical point (exactly known in 2d due to the Onsager solution)

The Monte Carlo algorithm can be based on proposed local moves of Glauber type (i.e. spin flip) and accepted with respect to the Metropolis-Hastings filter. It would be interesting to see how the above mentioned observables behaves as a function of the system size and perform a finite-size scaling analysis to estimate some critical exponents such as the gamma exponent that governs the divergence of chi at

A discussion on how to collect uncorrelated data and on the critical slowing down problem can be also considered.

## Abstract

The purpose of this work is to present a numerical study of the second-order phase transition in the 2D Ising model. 
Energy, magnetization, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility are computed with a special focus on their behaviour around the critical temperature.
In particular, critical exponents and the critical temperature are estimated by using computational methods such as nonlinear fits and finite-size scaling techniques. 
In order to do so, Monte Carlo simulations are performed for different lattice sizes with periodic boundary conditions.
